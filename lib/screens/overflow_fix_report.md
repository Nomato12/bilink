// Overflow Fix Report for BiLink Transport Service Map

/*
This document outlines the changes made to fix the RenderFlex overflow issue
in the transport_service_map_updated.dart file.
*/

## Issue Description
The vehicle cards in the horizontal ListView were overflowing by approximately 
25 pixels at the bottom, causing a RenderFlex overflow error.

## Changes Made

1. Container Height Adjustments:
   - Reduced the parent container height from 200px to 190px
   - Reduced the ListView container height from 150px to 140px
   - Reduced the image height from 90px to 80px

2. Layout Optimization:
   - Added `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` to the main Column widget
   - Kept the `constraints: BoxConstraints(maxHeight: 185)` on the vehicle container
   - Kept the `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` on the inner Column

3. Text Optimizations:
   - Kept the `maxLines: 1` and `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis` on text widgets
   - Maintained reduced font sizes (13px for title, 11px for company name)
   - Kept reduced padding (8px horizontal, 4px vertical)

## Verification

To verify the fix worked correctly:
1. Run the `verify_overflow_fix.bat` script
2. Check that no red/yellow striped areas appear around the vehicle cards
3. Verify scrolling works properly in the horizontal ListView

## Notes
The file had some syntax issues that were addressed during the fix. The changes
were made to minimize the height requirements while maintaining the visual design.

If any overflow issues persist, further adjustments to padding, margins, or text
sizes may be needed.
