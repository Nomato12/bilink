# BiLink Notification System Implementation

This documentation outlines the implementation of the notification system in the BiLink application to ensure that clients receive notifications when service providers accept their service requests.

## Components

Our notification system consists of:

1. **FCM Service** - Handles Firebase Cloud Messaging
2. **Notification Service** - Business logic for creating and sending notifications
3. **Cloud Functions** - Server-side code for sending FCM notifications
4. **Debug Tools** - Utilities for testing and troubleshooting notifications

## Implementation Details

### FCM Service (`lib/services/fcm_service.dart`)

The FCM service manages:
- Requesting notification permissions
- Initializing local notifications
- Saving device tokens to Firestore
- Sending notifications to users
- Handling background and foreground messages

### Notification Service (`lib/services/notification_service.dart`)

The notification service:
- Creates notifications in Firestore
- Updates service request status
- Integrates with FCM service to send notifications
- Manages notification read status

### Cloud Functions (`functions/index.js`)

The Firebase Cloud Functions:
- Listen for new notification documents in Firestore
- Send FCM messages to user devices
- Clean up invalid device tokens
- Update notification status after sending

### Debugging Tools

1. **Notification Debug Helper** (`lib/utils/notification_debug_helper.dart`)
   - Provides utilities for debugging notification issues
   - Tests FCM token storage and retrieval
   - Checks notification permissions

2. **Notification Debug Screen** (`lib/screens/notification_debug_screen.dart`)
   - User interface for testing notifications
   - Displays FCM token and notification status
   - Allows sending test notifications

3. **Test Script** (`test_fcm_notifications.bat`)
   - Command-line tool for testing notifications
   - Verifies FCM token storage
   - Checks for failed notifications

## Usage

### Sending Notifications

When a service provider accepts a service request:

```dart
// Example code in service_request_card.dart
await notificationService.updateRequestStatus(
  requestId: requestId,
  status: 'accepted',
  additionalMessage: message,
);
```

This triggers:
1. Updating the request status in Firestore
2. Creating a notification document in Firestore
3. Sending an FCM notification to the client

### Testing

To test the notification system:

1. Use the Notification Debug Screen in the app
2. Run the `test_fcm_notifications.bat` script
3. Check Firebase Console for notification status

## Setup

To set up the cloud functions:

1. Follow the instructions in `fcm_deployment_instructions.md`
2. Deploy the cloud functions to Firebase

## Troubleshooting

If notifications are not working:

1. Check that users have granted notification permissions
2. Verify FCM tokens are properly saved in Firestore
3. Check Cloud Functions logs for errors
4. Use the Notification Debug Screen to send test notifications

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for topic-based notifications
2. Implement notification grouping for better user experience
3. Add support for rich notifications with images
4. Implement notification analytics
