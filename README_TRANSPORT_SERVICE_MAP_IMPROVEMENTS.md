# Transport Service Map Improvements

## Overview
This update improves the transport service map in the BiLink app by:

1. Implementing real road routes between origin and destination instead of straight lines
2. Adding accurate distance calculation based on actual routes rather than straight-line distance
3. Adding route duration information to the UI
4. Fixing null safety issues in the map components
5. Improving the search suggestion UI to hide when users tap on the map or stop typing

## Technical Changes

### 1. Real Road Routes
- Added polyline support with the Google Directions API to show actual roads
- Implemented dashed line styling for better visibility
- Routes now follow real roads instead of straight lines between points

### 2. Accurate Distance Calculation
- Distance is now calculated based on the actual route from the Directions API
- The app falls back to straight-line distance only if the API call fails
- This provides more realistic distance estimates for pricing

### 3. Route Duration Information
- Added travel time estimates from the Directions API
- Shows duration in both screens (map and vehicle selection)
- Users can now see how long the journey will take

### 4. Null Safety Fixes
- Fixed null safety issues in the TransportServiceMapUnified component
- Added proper null checks and fallbacks for the direction results
- Improved error handling for the Google Maps controller

### 5. UI Improvements
- Search suggestions only show when actively typing and with focus
- Suggestions hide when tapping on the map
- Added a route information card showing distance and time
- "Swap locations" now recalculates the route automatically

## How to Apply
To apply these changes, run the `fix_transport_service_map.bat` file from the project root directory.

## Notes
The implementation uses the Google Directions API with the same API key already used in the app. No additional configuration is needed.

## Future Improvements
- Add alternative routes options
- Allow route customization (avoid tolls, highways, etc.)
- Show traffic information
- Add ETA based on current traffic conditions
