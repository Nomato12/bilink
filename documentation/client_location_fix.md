# Client Location Display Fix

## Issue Description
In the BILink application, there was an issue with the client location display in the ServiceRequestCard component. When a user clicked the "موقع العميل" (client location) button, the app would show a "طلب الموقع" (request location) dialog instead of displaying the already stored location data that was available in the client details screen.

## Fix Applied
The issue was resolved by changing how the client location buttons work in the ServiceRequestCard component:

1. **Changed Client Location Button Behavior**: 
   - Before: The button would call `_fetchAndNavigateToClientLocation` method, which would try to fetch the location from Firestore and show a request dialog if the location wasn't found
   - After: The button now navigates directly to the `ClientDetailsScreen` which already loads and displays the client's location properly

2. **Updated UI Elements**:
   - Changed button text from "طلب الموقع" (request location) to "عرض الموقع" (view location)
   - Updated button icon from `location_searching` to `location_on`
   - Changed button color from amber to green to indicate it's showing existing data rather than requesting new data

## Files Modified
- `lib/widgets/service_request_card.dart`
  - Modified the top mini location button (`InkWell` widget)
  - Modified the location section button (`ElevatedButton` widget)

## How It Works Now
1. When a user views a service request and clicks on either of the client location buttons, they are now taken directly to the ClientDetailsScreen
2. ClientDetailsScreen already handles loading and displaying the client's location data, including showing it on a Google Map
3. The user experience is improved since they can immediately see the client's location without having to request it again

## Benefits
- More consistent user experience
- Faster access to client location data
- Avoids redundant data fetching
- Provides a more intuitive UI where the button text matches what it actually does

## Verification
The fix was verified by:
1. Checking that the buttons properly navigate to the ClientDetailsScreen
2. Ensuring the button text and appearance were updated correctly
3. Confirming that no more calls to `_fetchAndNavigateToClientLocation` are made
