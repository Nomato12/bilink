## Testing Instructions

Use the provided test scripts to verify the changes:
- `test_transport_location_ui.bat` - For a complete test with a clean install
- `run_with_updated_transport_location.bat` - For a quick test of the updated UI

## Expected Results

After selecting both origin and destination locations, you should see:
1. A route displayed on the map between the two points
2. Vehicle markers (green) appearing near the destination
3. The vehicle list sliding up from the bottom with available transport options
4. Each vehicle card showing:
   - Vehicle type
   - Distance
   - Driver rating
   - Price
   - Booking button

## Known Limitations

- The vehicles displayed are simulated and will not reflect actual available vehicles
- Some UI elements may need further refinement based on user feedback
- The booking flow ends at the tracking screen and doesn't complete a real booking
